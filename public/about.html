<h4><p>I've managed chain & franchise restaurants in the earlier days. After about 6 years of working in the restaurant industry, I decided to pursue my career in real estate.
  First, I worked as an loan officer's assistant for a mortgage broker. Then, I worked as a loan officer that paid me commission based on my sales volume. After some time, 
  I found even a better position that requires B2B sales as an account executive for a mortgage lender. It has only been two years since I started working as an account executive,
  but i'm absolutely loving it. I also have an NMLS license and a real estate salesperson license. On the side, I invest in the stock market and real estates. Learning how to increase my income and way of investing money
  really gets me going.

<h4><p>I currently work remotely and although I am "employed" by a company, I have a bit of flexibility with my time as I am commissioned. Working from home saves me a lot of time from 
  not having to drive back and forth to my office - especially because I live in Southern California. Commuting to my company's office will easily take two hours off my clock. With current 
  circumstances, I am able to use the time I have to learn new skills. So, I decided to learn web development and copywriting to add more sources of income.
